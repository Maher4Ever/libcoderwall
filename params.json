{"name":"Libcoderwall","body":"#Coderwall C API - libcoderwall\r\n\r\nA simple library to access the coderwall API. It provides data-structures and\r\nfunctions to make working with coderwall.com API easier from C/C++ applications.\r\n\r\n##Building the library\r\nFirst ensure you have [`cmake`](http://www.cmake.org/) installed on your machine.\r\nThen, enter the `build` directory (using `cd` for example) and run:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncmake .. && make all\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should generate the library file `libcoderwall.a` on Unix which you could\r\nthen link with your binaries.\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\n\r\nIt is easy to write applications that use `libcoderwall`. All you need to do\r\nto get access to the data-structures and function `libcoderwall` provides\r\nis to include the following header file in the source of your application:\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#include <coderwall/coderwall.h>\r\n\r\n/* Your code follows below ... */\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, when it's time to compile your appication, add the `include` directory to\r\nyour c-compiler include path and link aginst `libcoderwall`.\r\n\r\nFor a practical example on how to use the library with a program, see the `example`\r\ndirectory which also includes a file to compile the example with `cmake`.\r\n\r\nTo compile the example, just enter the `build` directory and run:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncmake .. && make coderwall_user\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen simply use the new program to see information about developers. For example,\r\nto see information about me run (assuming you are in the `build` directory):\r\n\r\n```\r\nexample/coderwall_user maher4ever\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Running the unit-tests\r\nThis library is tested using [`gtest`](http://code.google.com/p/googletest/). To run the tests, enter the `build`\r\ndirectory and run:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncmake .. && make check\r\n```\r\n\r\n##License\r\nSee the included `LICENSE` file.\r\n\r\n##Author\r\n[Maher Sallam](https://github.com/Maher4Ever)","tagline":"Simple library to access the coderwall API from C/C++","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
